By GPLv3 License term 7, we require that when you distribute a modified version of the software, you must obey GPLv3 License as well as the following additional terms: 

1. Use a different software name than SJMCL or SJMC Launcher;
2. Do not remove the function of sending user statistics to our statistics server (src-tauri/src/utils/sys_info.rs), and send only version numbers with prefix (more than two letters, e.g. XX-0.0.1).
3. Mark clearly in your repository README file, your distribution website or thread, Support documents, About Page in the software that your program is based on SJMCL and give out the url of the origin repository.

In this case, you may continue to compile and distribute the software under its original name.
